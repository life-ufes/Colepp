# üìä Colepp ‚Äî Cross-Platform Tool for Wearable Device Data Collection

[:brazil: version](README-PT-BR.md)
## üß© Description

**Colepp** is an **open-source** tool for collecting and synchronizing physiological and movement data from wearable devices such as smartwatches and heart rate monitor straps.  

The system consists of **two main modules**:
- **Mobile (Android)** ‚Äî centralizes data control and storage, manages connections, and exports collected data.
- **Wear (Wear OS)** ‚Äî runs on the smartwatch, collects onboard sensor data, and sends it to the mobile app.

The focus is to enable **structured and synchronized data collection**, making it easier to create datasets for research in health monitoring, human activity recognition (HAR), and heart rate estimation algorithm development.

### Mobile Module (Android)
- **Device connection**: pairing with Polar H10 strap (via BLE) and Wear OS smartwatch.
- **Simultaneous data collection**:
  - Polar H10: Accelerometer and heart rate via ECG.
  - Wear OS: Accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate via PPG.
- **Precise time synchronization** between data from both devices, with time offset protocol using the `MessageClient` API.
- **Local storage** in SQLite database.
- **On-demand CSV export**.
- **Intuitive interface**:
  - Home screen for new or past collections.
  - Usage instructions.
  - Session details with metadata and HR graph.
  - Real-time collection with connection status and updated data.

### Wear Module (Wear OS)
- **Standby screen**: indicates readiness and connection status.
- **Active collection screen**: displays estimated HR via PPG and visual collection indicator.
- **Continuous data transmission** to the mobile app.
- **Compatibility**: Wear OS 3 or higher.

## üì± User Guide

#### Start a new capture

1. On the **Home** screen, click **<code><img src="assets/ic_add.svg" width="14" height="14" style="vertical-align:middle;"> New capture</code>** in the bottom navigation menu.
2. You will be redirected to the **New capture** screen:
   - Enter a **name** with more than 3 characters (description is optional).
3. Click **Create** to go to the **Start capture** screen [(connection guide)](#connect-devices).
4. Make sure **both devices are connected**.
5. Click **Start**:
   - A 3-second countdown will appear before the capture starts.
6. The capture will be saved **locally** until you:
   - Click **Finish**  
   **or**
   - A device gets disconnected.
7. To finish, click **Back** and you will return to the **Home** screen, where you can see the list of all saved captures.

#### Connect devices

1. For the app to automatically detect and connect to the Polar H10 and the smartwatch, the devices must already be paired with your phone/tablet.
2. With Bluetooth turned on and the devices paired, simply click on each card to start automatic connection.
3. Wait a few seconds for them to connect; you will receive feedback when the connection is successful, and the button will be enabled.
4. For the smartwatch, when you click the card, the app will automatically launch on the device. If that does not happen, or if you prefer, you can manually open it by tapping the app icon directly on the smartwatch.

#### Delete a capture

1. On the **Home** screen, click the <img src="assets/ic_delete.svg" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:middle;"> icon on the capture card you want to delete.
2. A confirmation dialog will appear, as **data cannot be recovered** after deletion.
3. To confirm, click **Delete**.
4. To cancel, click **Cancel**.

#### Edit a capture

1. On the **Home** screen, click the <img src="assets/ic_edit.svg" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:middle;"> icon on the capture card you want to edit.
2. You will be redirected to the **Edit capture** screen, where you can change the name and description.
3. To save changes, click **Save**.
4. To discard changes, click **Back** in the upper-left corner or use the navigation bar.

#### Download a capture in CSV format

1. Click the **card** of the desired capture.
2. On the **capture details** screen, click the <img src="assets/ic_download.svg" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:middle;"> icon in the top-right corner.
3. Wait for the **loading** dialog while the file is being generated.
